# Syllabus for HONR 202 Spring 2018, Critical Reading: Digital Thoreau

Meetings
--------

MW 10:30 am - 11:45 am Milne 213


Course description
------------------

What does critical reading look like in the digital age? We'll attempt to answer this question not only by learning how a new generation of scholars is approaching the task of editing, analyzing, interpreting, and contextualizing texts under the banner of "digital humanities," but also by using digital tools to advance our own critical understanding of works by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau. Students in this course will apply what they learn about text encoding, computational text analysis, and other tools directly to SUNY Geneseo's ongoing digital project about Thoreau at [http://digitalthoreau.org](http://digitalthoreau.org).

Learning outcomes
-----------------

What will you know and be able to do as a result of taking this course? (If you do the work, that is.)

- You'll understand how the meaning of "critical reading" has and hasn't changed since the advent of computing as a tool for literary and historical study.
- You'll be able to generate and share critical perspectives on the work of Henry David Thoreau through the use of digital technology.
- You'll be competent, at a basic level, in using digital methods to carry out three core tasks of the humanities: editing, archiving, and analysis.

Assessment
----------

How will we know if you’ve met these outcomes?

- You'll successfully contribute to the ongoing work of [Digital Thoreau](http://digitalthoreau.org), a resource that uses digital tools for editing, archiving, and analysis to preserve and promote understanding of American writer Henry David Thoreau's legacy. 
- You'll share your developing critical perspectives on Thoreau and the activity of critical reading through posts to the [Digital Humanities at Geneseo](http://dh.sunygeneseoenglish.org) public blog.
- You'll successfully complete other assignments that require you to use some basic tools of digital scholarship.
