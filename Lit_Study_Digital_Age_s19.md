If you have an accommodation letter, let me know as soon as possible in the semester so we can discuss specific arrangements.

Take care of yourself
---------------------

It's hard work being a student! You can improve your chances of success by eating well, getting enough sleep, and making wise choices. **If you need help, ask for it.** [Student Health and Counseling](https://www.geneseo.edu/health) can help you if you're sick or need psychological or emotional support. A variety of [Campus Learning Centers](https://www.geneseo.edu/library/center-academic-excellence), including the [Writing Learning Center](https://www.geneseo.edu/english/writing_center), offer academic support services. **And then there's me.** [Schedule an appointment](http://schacht.youcanbook.me) to see me in my office for help with assignments, to tell me if you're facing basic obstacles to success such as food insecurity, to continue the conversation about readings and topics in the course, or just to check out my Apple IIe computer. - If reading or discussing certain kinds of content in this course might prove traumatic for you, let me know and we'll work together to figure out a reasonable solution. You should be prepared for the fact that some works on the syllabus contain depictions of or allusions to violence and sexuality.

Think about others
------------------

-   Express yourself honestly but respectfully
-   Practice [forbearance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forbearance) when offended by others, even as you exercise your right to explain your reasons for taking offense
-   Consider how the world looks to someone who is not you
-   Do your best to address others as they prefer to be addressed
